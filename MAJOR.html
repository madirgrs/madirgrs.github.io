  <h1>Majoring in IT</h1>
  <p>IT was not what I originally planned on doing at all until last semester. Throughout high school as well as the beginning of last semester, I planned on majoring in Art and focusing on graphic design. It wasn't until I really struggled with the idea of being stuck with only one form of media. I really enjoyed audio production, video editing, and special effects and I feel like I would've lost all that with just graphic design. IT however was a clear choice for me and provided me with everything I was looking for!</p>
  
  <h2>Coding</h2>
  <p>Before starting this major I had never done any code before. I have learned a lot already so here's an example of  code I've done so far.</p>
  
  <h3>List Loops Python</h3>

  <pre>
  <code>
#total of numbers
list = ["6","5","3","8","4","2","5","4","11","43","1","17","27","90","77","62","51","47","82","86","20"]

number_of_elements = len(list)
print("How many numbers are in this list:", number_of_elements)


#sum
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]

sum = 0

for value in numbers:
 sum = sum + value

print("The sum of these numbers is",sum)


#average
list = ["6","5","3","8","4","2","5","4","11","43","1","17","27","90","77","62","51","47","82","86","20"]

average = sum / len(list)

for value in numbers:
 sum = sum + value

print("The average of these numbers is", average)


#print all numbers in list
print()
print("Printing all list items:")

list = ["6","5","3","8","4","2","5","4","11","43","1","17","27","90","77","62","51","47","82","86","20"]
x = 0
while x < len(list):
 print("Item", x, "is -", list[x])
 x = x + 1
 

#print every other number in list
print()
print("Printing every other list item:")


list = ["6","5","3","8","4","2","5","4","11","43","1","17","27","90","77","62","51","47","82","86","20"]

x = 0
for index, element in enumerate(list):
 if index % 2 == 0:
  print("Item", x, "is -", element)
  x = x + 2
  
#bonus even and odd
print()
print("Bonus: Printing even numbered values from the list:")

list = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]

i = 0

while i < len(list):
 if(list[i] % 2 == 0):
  print("Item", i, "is even -", list[i])
 else:
  print("Item", i, "is odd -", list[i])
 i = i + 1
